# ww2stats

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ww2stats is to show the deaths suffered by nations who participated in World War 2

## Installation

You can install the development version of ww2stats like so:

``` r
# Go onto my github account, install how is required by your system, run the package
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how many people both civilians and military died in World War 2 for each nation who participated:

```{r example}
library(ww2stats)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
